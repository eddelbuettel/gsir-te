An [eight-page pdf guide](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/gsir-te/Getting-Started-in-R.pdf) for "Getting Started in R".

### Objective

To create a short guide that gives a quick overview and introduction to R. 

![](docs/Getting-Started-in-R.p1p2.png)

### How?

* Using a practical approach of showing how to do things immediately using realistic 
examples and a real life dataset. 
* Avoiding technical details where possible.
* Making it fun and interesting.

### For whom?

* Beginners.
* Data scientists, statisticians, programmers, ... who want to get a flavour of R.
* Those who want a quick refresher guide to R.
* The curious.

### Outcome

* After reading the guide, following the examples and doing exercises you will 
learn how to manipulate, visualise and summarise data.
* Hopefully you will have the curiousity to learn more :)
