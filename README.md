# Getting Started in R

**An 8 page PDF "Getting Started in R" Guide.**

**Objective** 

To create a short guide that gives a quick overview and introduction to R and 
the `tidyverse` package.

**How?**

* Using a practical approach of showing how to do things immediately using realistic 
examples and a real life dataset. 
* Avoiding technical details where possible.
* Making it fun and interesting.

**For whom?**

* Beginners.
* Data scientists, statisticians, programmers, ... who want to get a flavour of R.
* Those who want a quick refresher guide to R.
* The curious.

**Outcome**

* After reading the guide, following the examples and doing exercises you will 
learn how to manipulate, visualise and summarise data.
* Hopefully you will have the curiousity to learn more :)
